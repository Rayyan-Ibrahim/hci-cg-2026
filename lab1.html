            <h2>Dix HCI Reading</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>From Alan Dix Book <a href="Book.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">Page 8</a>, The example of the <strong>automatic syringe / dose calculator</strong> showed how dangerous poor design can be in safety-critical systems. Even if the system is technically correct, confusing displays or unclear feedback can cause users to enter the wrong dose. This made me realise that in HCI, designers can’t assume users will “figure it out,” especially when stress or time pressure is involved.</li>
                <li><strong>“Improve your memory”</strong><a href="Book.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">(Chapter 1, Page 39)</a> was quite interesting because it shows that memory can be trained using simple techniques. By linking numbers with familiar words and creating clear mental images, remembering information becomes much easier.</li>
                <li><strong>“Human error and false memories”</strong><a href="Book.pdf#page=76" target="_blank">(Chapter 1, Page 49-50)</a> was quite interesting because it shows that mistakes often happen due to poor design, not careless users. It also explains how our brain fills in missing details, which can create false memories. This helps us understand why good interface design is so important.</li>
                <li><strong>“Readability of text”</strong><a href="Book.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">(Chapter 2, Page 101)</a> is very important in interface design because small text choices can greatly affect how fast and easily users read. As shown in the example, all capital letters text takes longer to read than lower case, while uppercase is better for short codes like flight numbers or key presses. This shows designers must choose text styles based on how the text will be used.</li>
                <li>From <a href="Book.pdf#page=154" target="_blank">Chapter 3, Page 127 - 128</a>, The concepts of the <strong>Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation</strong>were also interesting. They explain the gap between what a user wants to do and how easily they can do it, and then how easily they can understand what the system has done. If these gulfs are too wide, users are more likely to make mistakes. This helped me understand why some apps feel frustrating even when they technically work fine.</li>
                <li><strong>How to design websites for screen readers</strong><a href="Book.pdf#page=401" target="_blank"> Chapter 10, Page 374</a>. Web designers should ensure accessibility for screen reader users by using text alternatives like HTML ‘alt’ tags and clear navigation. Content should read logically across a page, avoiding confusing layouts such as columns. Links should be placed clearly, preferably at the top of pages. Tools and guidelines from WebAIM, WAI, and Bobby help test and improve website accessibility.</li>
                <li>From <a href="Book.pdf#page=451" target="_blank">Chapter 12, Page 424</a> <strong>How GOMS saves money?</strong> NYNEX used GOMS and PERT-style analysis to evaluate a new operator system before installation. The study showed the system would slow down operations instead of improving them. By abandoning the project early, GOMS analysis saved the company millions of dollars..</li>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>T/F:</strong> Every link inside <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> must be placed inside an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.✅ TRUE</li>
            <li>
            <strong>T/F:</strong> A page may have multiple <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> headings to make text larger.❌ FALSE 
            because <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> 
            is meant to represent the main heading of a page, not just for size. To make text larger, use CSS
            </li>
            <li><strong>T/F:</strong> <code>aria-current="page"</code> should be used on the active navigation item.✅ TRUE</li>
            <li>
            <strong>T/F:</strong> A form is accessible even if it has no <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements.❌ FALSE 
            because <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> improves accessibility. Without labels, screen readers may not know what each input is for.
            </li>
            <li><strong>T/F:</strong> KLM predicts execution time for expert, error-free performance.✅ TRUE</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Part C: Short Answer</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Question 1:</strong>Explain the difference between a semantic element (e.g., <code>nav</code>) and a generic element (e.g., <code>div</code>).</li>
            <p>
            <strong> Answer 1:</strong>
            A semantic element (e.g., <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>) clearly describes its content and meaning, helping browsers, screen
            readers, and search engines understand the page, while a generic element (e.g., <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) is just a
            container with no inherent meaning and is used mainly for styling or layout.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Question 2:</strong>Why does KLM not model high-level planning and interpretation?</li>
            <p>
            <strong> Answer 2:</strong>
            KLM focuses on low-level, expert, error-free actions to predict execution time, so it does not model
            high-level planning or interpretation, which are cognitive processes outside its scope.

        <h2>UI Errors of OLX Pakistan</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>Logo Confusion:</strong> 
        As the updated logo's design made it harder for users to recognize the brand quickly.
        </li>

        <li>
        <strong>Visual Overload after Redesign:</strong> 
        Too many features and options were added without a clear visual hierarchy, making primary actions like "post an ad" or "contact seller" harder to recognize.
        </li>
 
        <li>
        <strong>Unorganized Interface:</strong> 
        With too many ads, users accidentally click on ads instead of real listings.
        </li>

        <li>
        <strong>Poor Feedback and System Communication:</strong> 
        Sometimes ads go into a "Not Published" state with little explanation, and the user doesn't know why.
